## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent:

- [Setup]: Sandbox account is the only place new behavior is first tested (no prod first-tries).
- [Setup]: Keep pg_cron + pg_net → Edge Function; harden to hourly.
- [Setup]: Multi-account fan-out keyed by an `acculynx_accounts` registry (9 keys: 8 prod + sandbox).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Locate/verify each location key's account binding and the sandbox key's behavior (Phase 1, first task).
- `v_acculynx_cron_outcomes` shows historical runs as `pending` — pg_net reconciliation must be fixed in Phase 3.
